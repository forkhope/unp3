A common way to describe the layers in a network is to use the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) open systems interconnection (OSI)
model for computer communications. This is a seven-layer model, which we
show in Figure 1.14 along with the approximate mapping to the Internet
protocol suite.

下面描述 OSI model 和 Internet protocol suite 各层之间的对应关系.
We consider the bottom two layers of the OSI model as the device driver and
networking hardware that are supplied with the system. Normally, we need
not concern ourselves with these layers other than being aware of some
properties of the datalink, such as the 1500-byte Ethernet maximum transfer
unit (MTU).

The network layer is handled by the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. The transport
layers that we can choose from are TCP and UDP. We show a gap between TCP
and UDP in Figure 1.14 to indicate that it is possible for an application
to bypass the transport layer and use IPv4 or IPv6 directly. This is called
a raw socket.

The upper three layers of the OSI model are combined into a single layer
called the application. This is the Web client (browser), Telnet client,
Web server, FTP server, or whatever application we are using. With the
Internet protocols, there is rarely any distinction between the upper three
layers of the OSI model.

注意: 上面早 application 和 "TCP, UDP" 之间有两行: sockets 和 XTI. 这两个
是不同的概念. XTI 指的是 X/Open Transport Interface,是另外一套网络编程接口.
