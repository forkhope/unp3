书中练习1.5提到: Change the single call to write() into a loop that calls
write() for each byte of the result string. 例如:
    for (i = 0; i < strlen(buff); i++)
        Write(connfd, &buff[i], 1);
那么,客户端在用 while 循环读取服务器过来的数据时,客户端会执行多少次循环?

书中给出的答案是: 视情况而定.
The results vary, depending on the client host and server host. If the
client and server are on the same host, the counter is normally 1, which
means even though the server does 26 writes, the data is returned by a
single read(). But, one combination of client and esrver may produce two
packets, and another combination 26 packets.

The purpose of this example is to reiterate that different TCPs do
differrent things with the data and our application must be prepared to
read the data as a stream of bytes until the end of the data stream is
encountered.
