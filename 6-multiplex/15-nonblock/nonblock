Exercises 6.2. When describling the conditions for which select() returns
"writable" in Section 6.3, why did we need the qualifier that the socket
had to be nonblocking for a write operation to return a positive value?

Answer: If select() tells us that the socket is writable, the socket send
buffer has room for 8,192 bytes, but when we call write() for this blocking
socket with a buffer length of 8,193 bytes, write() can block, waiting for
room for the final byte. Read operations on a blocking socket will always
return a short count if some data is available, but write operations on a
blocking socket will block until all the data can be accepted by the kernel.
Therefore, when using select() to test for writability, we must set the
socket to nonblocking to avoid blocking.
即,当write()函数传入的buffer字符数大于socket发送缓冲区的长度时,阻塞型的
write()能够阻塞来等待socket发送缓冲区有空间来接收write()函数多出来的字符.
