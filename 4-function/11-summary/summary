#### Summary ####
All clients and servers begin with a call to socket(), returning a socket
descriptor. Clients then call connect(), while servers call bind(),
listen(), and accept(). Sockets are normally closed with the standard
close() function, although we will see another way to do this with the
shutdown() function.

Most TCP servers are concurrent, with the server calling fork() for every
client connection that it handles. We will see that most UDP servers are
iterative.
